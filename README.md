# albers

This map applies dynamic [Albers equal-area conic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albers_projection) to the Mapzen vector tiles, using the Tangram JavaScript mapping library.

Usually, an Albers map is specified with a particular center, and one or two "standard parallels", which are lines of latitude which have no shape distortion â€“ this map adjusts all of these parameters with the movement of the map.
